 position: relative

    absolute is relative to the first relative position it can find - .header

*block* elements occupy the entire width and *provide line breaks from both ends*
*inline-block* element is placed as an inline element (on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block element.

*Pseudo class* like .btn:link is a special state of the selector

*Pseudo element* like .btn::after is not selectable treated like a child of the element

z-index: -1             // behind
